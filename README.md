Using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions.

- AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

- App will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

- Display the following under current weather conditions:

  - City
  - Date
  - Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - UV index

  Included a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.

- Included a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the      following:
  - Date
  - Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
